Letter Quest Remastered helping tool

Background: I was annoyed with the fact that I would never remember the Python syntax.
So annoyed, that one day, while my room mate and I were playing Letter Quest Remastered, I had an idea: You know what good excercise I could do in order to remember the Python syntax? Write a script that might help us to figure out words while playing the game!

And yep, here it is!

Have fun.
